In this role I was pursued to design, develop and continuosly maintain the main online resource for swedish magazine Betong.se
A daily news outlet, the biggest of its kind for all things concrete â€“ architecture, design, research and construction.

While keeping the platform maintained, overseeing hosting issues, updating plugins and tweaking functionality I also proposed and developed solutions for the reader community to participate and drive more traffic to the site.

With concepts such as weekly polls, a content driven newsletter, a voting system for each years grand gala, and an interface for a community driven Q & A, betong.se featured more than a million unique page views during my time as developer and designer.

This role has a huge part in shaping my knowledge and experience and later became the backbone of my freelancing business, which i still pursue today.
