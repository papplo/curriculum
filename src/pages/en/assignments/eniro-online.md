Eniro has a long history with a business model providing up to date information and content on local businesses in the nordics.

I worked as a frontend developer together with stakeholders and product owner, designing and developing the first iteration of NÃ¤rvarokollen.se

The portal gathers data from several Rest Api:s and measures a result based on your business's key contact information. As a way to generate leads for Eniros sales force, i used a combination of Wordpress and WooCommerce to record and store users signups to the service.

- Design and creation of wireframes and prototypes for the user journey. (Ux/Ui)
- Development of the apps user interface (Rest Api, Javascript)
- Packaging of app into a custom Wordpress Plugin, together with custom Woocommerce templates (WP, WpEngine)
