Tobii develops and sells proprietary technology, pioneering the usage of Eye Tracking in various genres and business applications, both commercial, medtech and leisure/ gaming.

My work at the Tech Marketing team was to maintain and develop various aspects of the main B2C-sales channel, aswell as overviewing the user experience and campaign work of the team.

In a team of marketers, backend-developers and ux-designers, i was involved in an agile process, with the aim of delivering continous upgrades to the platform (_WooCommerce_, _Wordpress_).
