I have worked as a programmer and designer since 2010 and have nurtured a passion for modern and customer-centric solutions online.

Over the past years, I have had the opportunity to take various roles, fundamental to shape my knowledge in _Web Development_, _Visual Communication_ and _Ui / Ux-design_. IÂ´ve built a habit and feel confident working in agile teams closely with developers, designers and stakeholders.

My experience has helped form my work ethics and my technical knowledge, along with a deep understanding of the business side of things. I will always argue for the importance of measurability while giving an interdisciplinary approach to all my work to leverage the end user experience.
